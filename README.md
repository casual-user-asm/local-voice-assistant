# Voice Assistant – Local AI Chat with Speech
A simple and privacy-friendly voice assistant that runs entirely on your local machine. It uses powerful open-source tools for speech recognition, text-to-speech, and AI conversation — with no cloud dependencies.

# What was used:

Whisper – for Speech-to-Text (STT). It listens to your voice and converts it to text.

Ollama – runs the local LLM (Large Language Model) for generating responses.

Coqui.ai TTS – handles Text-to-Speech (TTS), so the assistant can speak replies out loud.
